Edit the form in `index.php` to do the following:
1. Send the data without having it appear in the URL
2. Send the data to `result.php`

Then edit `result.php` to check whether the user submitted an age of 19 or over. If the age submitted is over that limit output "Welcome to Duff Beer". Otherwise output "Sorry, you are not old enough to enter this site."
